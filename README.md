X52 Repair
==========

I bought a second hand X52 HOTAS set but almost immediately a the joystick broke, probably due to abuse in the hands of the previous owner.

Investigation lead to finding the offending parts and one of them is unlikely to hold togethet with glue (the other one seems strong enough after generous application of epoxy), so time to make a new one. [Some measurements](https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Kix43ijV4Hcf4FL3ljtJQtMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink) and [updated ones](https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/lZT8RpTLRAX-mXj5O0_kWtMTjNZETYmyPJy0liipFm0?feat=directlink), in any case the STL/SCAD files should probably be considered the best source of measurements for this part.

Anyway, I made a mistake while milling a replacement from aluminium and never got around to start over, so I made a 3D model and will now see if a printed part will work. If not I'll probably get one CNCd from Delrin or maybe Alu somewhere.
